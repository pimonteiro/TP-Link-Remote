I pretend to implement a camera feed to allow me to see the state of the device connected to the HS100. Right now is a webpage, but im trying to "convert" it to an actual android app.
Sorry for the bad organization of the files, it was my first touch with html, javascript and etc.
Appreciate any kind of feedback :)


This was only possible thanks to Alexandre Dumont and his blog talking about different ways to control this device.
